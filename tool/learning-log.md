# Tool Learning Log

Tool: **Aframe**

### Aframe
1. Making a box
 The code  ```<a-box>``` forms objects like walls, cubes, and boxes.
 2. Creating a camera
 The code ``` <a-camera>``` decides what the user's view is. By altering the position and rotation of the camera entity, we may change the viewport.
3. Creating text
 The code ```<a-text>``` allows whoever is making the code to use text inside their project so that other people may use it to read.
4. Creating a plane
   No, not an actual plane. The code ```<a-plane>``` uses the geometry component with the type set to plane to produce flat surfaces.
5. Creating an image
   The code ```<a-image>``` displays a picture on a level surface or as we call it, the plane.

Today we were working on 2 wireframes using the our tool. My tool is aframe, I will be intending to make a minecraft demo . 
The code I am using is 

```<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
<body>
  <a-scene>
  </a-scene>
</body>
  <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
<a-scene>
  <a-cylinder id="ground" src="https://cdn.aframe.io/a-painter/images/floor.jpg" radius="32" height="0.1"></a-cylinder>
</a-scene>
```

The link I used was (https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/guides/building-a-minecraft-demo.html) The progress I made was i figured out how to make a casual demo where you are able to move around using the aframe tool for my project and now need to add more components.
