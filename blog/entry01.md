##### 10/23/23

## Why sports?
The topic that I have chosen for this project is sports because as a kid and now as a young adult I have been playing sports for a long time and I have been watching it since I was a kid. I considered making this project about military or cooking but I decided that sports was the best subject to choose. one of my favorite article about this topic is ["Technology Is Changing the Way We Interact With Sports"] (https://www.rollingstone.com/culture-council/articles/technology-changing-the-way-we-interact-with-sports-1234720624/) Seeing all of the different ways new technology has been implemented in sports was truly fascinating and made me even more passionate about sports than I already was. 


## Engineering Design Process
I'm currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve with my project is that **people are not informed about the world of technology in Sports**. The following stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my peers and those around me to discuss the issue and gain their input on the situation. 

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, **communication** as well as **how to read**. 


## Time managment 
I have several commitments outside of school, such as picking up my brother, practicing for the soccer team, being a fighter and helping my brothers along with their work. My work at school is getting busier and I'm not getting enough sleep so i decided to make time for the project by playing soccer on the weekends instead of the weekdays. Doing this has helped me get my work done while doing other stuff as well. 

## How to google 
When I Googled about how sports correlates with technology many options showed up. Of Course I wasn't going to check all of the options that showed up. By skimming through the titles and the descritpions. Seeing articles like ["Sports Technology: How It's Changing The Game"] (https://www.jobsinsports.com/blog/2022/01/12/sports-technology-how-its-changing-the-game/#:~:text=Sports%20technology%20discerns%20interests%20and,were%20made%20or%20penalties%20occurred.) I knew I was on the right track of what I was searching for. 


## Communication 
Communication was a skill i developed. Since I was having trouble on what websites to use I had asked a friend to help me and we decided to talk about it. Initially, we were searching on our own and kept the results to ourselves. However, as a quick and effective way to communicate what we found, we eventually decided to share each others numbers so we had a way to communication . We want to discuss the project with each other at least once a week. 

## How to read
Learning to read was another ability I attained. We had to carefully examine each article to determine which one corresponded with the topic after searching online. There were several phrases I was unfamiliar with, so I looked them up on Google, which connects to my first ability. However, reading an article differs greatly from reading a book. Numerous articles feature headings and subheadings that help to organize the information into manageable reading segments.
