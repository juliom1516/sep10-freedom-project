## why sports?
The topic that I have chosen for this project is sports because as a kid and now as a young adult I have been playing sports for a long time and I have been watching it since I was a kid. I considered making this project about military or cooking but I decided that sports was the best subject to choose. one of my favorite article about this topic is ["Technology Is Changing the Way We Interact With Sports"] (https://www.rollingstone.com/culture-council/articles/technology-changing-the-way-we-interact-with-sports-1234720624/) Seeing all of the different ways new technology has been implemented in sports was truly fascinating and made me even more passionate about sports than I already was. 


##Engineering Design Process
I'm currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve with my project is that **people are not informed about the world of technology in Sports**. The following stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my peers and those around me to discuss the issue and gain their input on the situation. 

##Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, **communication** as well as **how to read**
