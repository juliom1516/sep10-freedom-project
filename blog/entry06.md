How I made my mvp
It took me a while to make my mvp but once I figured out what I was gonna do it was all downhill from that, I took different ideas and turned it into one. Once I started figuring out how to link a picture to a folder I decided to add a file and put a picture in that file, when I had done that I needed to figure out how to link that picture to the file of my aframe. 

Challenges
- Figuring out how to make the project
- How to change the background of the project
- Changing color of navbar
- Linking picture to file


Takeaways
Some of my takeaways is to be patient and to ask my friends for help if I need it, by being patient I learned to fix my code instead of rushing everything and leaving room for mistakes as well as making sure that my code was neat and where it should go. By asking friends for help I learned how to make my aframe and to use the different shapes and how to scale them. I also had help by making the plane of the code and the camera where you can move around
