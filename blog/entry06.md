How I made my mvp
It took me a while to make my mvp but once I figured out what I was gonna do it was all downhill from that, I took different ideas and turned it into one. Once I started figuring out how to link a picture to a folder I decided to add a file and put a picture in that file, when I had done that I needed to figure out how to link that picture to the file of my aframe. 

Challenges
- Figuring out how to make the project
- how to change the background of the project
- changing color of navbar
