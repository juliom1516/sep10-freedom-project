### Context  
I brainstormed part B because in sports the players get ingured while playing their sport. I've looked throughout the internet in search of looking for ways that players can be safe and we can track their scores as well. My sources for my freedom project were (https://cactusware.com/blog/sports-technology) and (https://www.sports-management-degrees.com/lists/five-exciting-new-technologies-being-used-in-the-sports-industry/), as I was scrolling through the websites I was writing down existing technology that already exist. 

### EDP
<li> The problem I was searching was how can we use sports technology and make advancements for players to track their scores </li>
<li>I researched the problem and I was able to find Software and hardware that already exisited that helped keep track of players analytics(example:Speed,Heart rate,and Accelerometers and gyroscopes which helps monitor position, rotation, acceleration and speed.)</li>
<li> The solutions I came up to make this easier for players so that they can keep track of their scores at all times is create a watch or a bracelet that will be able to take in all that data and store it for later use. </li>
