## Context
The tool I am using is Aframe. Aframe helps design virtual reality (VR) experiences. Because A-Frame is built on top of HTML, getting started is easier.The foundation of A-Frame is a strong entity-component framework that offers a declarative, extensible, and composable structure; it is more than just a 3D scene graph or a markup language.
