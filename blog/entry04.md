## Context
The tool I am using is Aframe. Aframe helps design virtual reality (VR) experiences. Since A-Frame is made on top of HTML, getting started is considered easier.

## Code I learned and what it does

1. Making a box
 The code  ```<a-box>``` forms objects like walls, cubes, and boxes.
2. Creating a camera
 The code ``` <a-camera>``` decides what the user's view is. By altering the position and rotation of the camera entity, we may change the viewport.
3. Creating text
 The code ```<a-text>``` allows whoever is making the code to use text inside their project so that other people may use it to read.
4. Creating a plane
   No, not an actual plane. The code ```<a-plane>``` uses the geometry component with the type set to plane to produce flat surfaces.
