## Context
The tool I am using is Aframe. Aframe helps design virtual reality (VR) experiences. Since A-Frame is made on top of HTML, getting started is considered easier.

## Code I Used
The code I used for for this project was ```<nav class="navbar fixed-top bg-body-tertiary">``` to make a nav bar that had a fixed top on the page. I also added different navbar items using the   ```<li class="nav-item">``` which allowed me to creat a certain name for the navbar along with where it would lead to

Another peice of code I used was ```<div id="Intro"> </div>``` which gave me the ability to give HTML element an id to change the style in css wether it was the color or size as well as it's location

## Takeaways
Take aways I had from this was figuring out how to give each HTML element its own Id so I can change the style properties.
